# GitHub Dashboard
Developed during the course [1dv612](http://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/web-application-architectures-and-frameworks/) at Linnaeus University.

A very simple GitHub dashboard for receiving notifications and setting webhooks on organisations that the user owns. The client-side was developed using React and the back-end functionality was developed using [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/).

The application is accessable on https://dhif4tawafcug.cloudfront.net
